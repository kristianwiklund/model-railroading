# Doors and windows for POLA-N station.

Print using an SLA printer.

Needed:

* 1 [large door](./large door.stl)
* 2 small door
* 2 large window
* 2 second largest window
* 1 third largest window
* 6 smallest window

The result is shown in the curing_video.mp4 in this directory.
The windows are way too thick (~15 cm to scale), but it will hopefully not be too visible.
