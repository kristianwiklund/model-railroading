# Restoration Progress

## "Before"

I got this station some time early 1980's, my best guess is that I was 11-13 at the time. The assembly was as expected, and the building was falling apart from using the wrong glue.
The paper on the inside was an attempt to remove severe light leakage through the walls.

# 3D-models for the doors and windows

Print using an SLA printer.

Needed:

* 1 [large door](large_door.stl)
* 2 [small door](small_door.stl)
* 2 [large window](large_windows.stl)
* 2 [second largest window](second_largest_window.stl)
* 1 [third largest window](third_largest_window.stl)
* 6 [smallest window](smallest_windows.stl)

Printed result: [video](media/curing_video.mp4)
The windows are way too thick (~15 cm to scale), but it will hopefully not be too visible.
